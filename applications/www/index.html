    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I have about 17 years of experience in the Mozilla community, at least as a localizer, SeaMonkey project manager, Stability Program manager on Mozilla staff, and of course, Mozilla Rep.
This involved a number of presentations about all those topics I've been involved with, in both German and English, at different events and conferences, repeatedly at FOSDEM's Mozilla devroom and Linuxwochen in Vienna, but also on a few other events.
The topics I'm most interested in are web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS/DOM) and experiments with those, in pure form of the APIs browsers implement, not abstracted away by libraries - and e.g. innovation on the web, data analysis, release processes, projects I developed for my own pleasure or needs, etc.</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I've been speaking on Mozilla topics for years and will continue to do that with or without this program. That said, I want to improve my abilities as a speaker, which I think this program can provide. I also want to get into an exchange with other Mozilla (tech) speakers on presentation materials to use and topics to spread to/at local events. I also would like to do more appearances at conferences if I have interesting stuff to talk about.</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> I'd be exited to join the awesome people already in the program! :)</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I have been an active tech speaker from the days of FirefoxOS but became much more focused during last 6 months when I started contributing to WebVR. I love to speak about latest trends in Javascript world as well as Virtual Reality. I always have content ready before the talk and prepare well in advance so that I can deliver meaningful content in short time. My stage fright days are long gone now but I still have to learn managing Q & A sessions. I've been following a similar approach for past one year while speaking as mentioned here - 

https://goo.gl/JLgdcq

<-- Following are my current "Tech Speaker" activities -->

* A-Frame and Virtual Reality at Software Freedom Day, Hyderabad (17th September, 2016) - https://goo.gl/G3EFSI

* Organized, took sessions and gave A-Frame demos at WebVR Camp, Hyderabad (Overnight Hackathon) throughout the whole night(15th October, 2016) -

    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> ** Personal:
 - Improving posture, gestures and eye-contact.
 - Remain calm, clear and focused while speaking.
 - Improve pitching skills for applying at various tech-conferences.
 - Creating better content.
** Community:
 - Share the skills that I'll be learning in this program to other tech speakers in community (who are not under 'Tech Speakers Program')
 - Reaching out to remote areas where tech speakers are not available during local Mozilla events.
** Web:
 - Spread awareness about Mozilla's efforts towards open web through various other open source projects that we contribute to, apart from Firefox (which most people already know).</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Soon to be graduated, BSc. in ICT, I'm mostly focused on my thesis work and recently presented a part of my research work at IEEE ICCIT, happened in BD and it's my 8th conference as a paper presenter. I work on Software Defined Network Security and Performance aspects and previously did work with ZigBee protocol performance issues. 
Apart from that, as a Mozillian I did organized local events related to IoT device hacking and also am one of the Regional Coordinator of Mozilla Club, Mozilla Learning Network where we teach web literacy and conduct new club forming and training for the newbie Club Captains </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> As a volunteer I have to engage with people in real time whom I have to explain and sometimes mentor about the technical term, skill and knowledge. A good representation and self confident is something I feel absent. Participating Tech Speaker program I wish to overcome the lacking I have from the technical perspective. 
I believe the knowledge and experience I might get from this program will allow me to make others confident when I share things I will learn from the program and this training will boost up my confidence as a technical-speaker while in a conference upnext.

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I began to give tech talks when Firefox OS arrived to Madagascar. I was in the Firefox OS Africa marketing team and I gave talks to young developers on how to develop for this new OS. The talk that I gave was about how to use Open Web Technologies like HTML and JavaScript to create awesome Web Apps. https://reps.mozilla.org/e/orange-klif-app-challenge/

This year, I went to the city of Mahajanga to give a talk about Mozilla, the Open Web and Online Privacy. There again, the focus of the talk was Open Technologies. Our goal was to give them the tools to create Web Apps using technologies they already know (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) https://reps.mozilla.org/e/mahajanga-moztalk/

At work, I also gave a talk during a meeting about different web frameworks (I am a Front End Developer). I talked about AngularJS, EmberJS, KnockoutJS, React and React Native.

I leaded many MozCoffees and I am very comfortable with public speaking. And I love tech, so I am always very excited and passionate when talking about it.</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I want to become a Tech Speaker because I don't want to keep my passion for tech to myself. I want to give talks because I enjoy it; I enjoy sharing with others.
I love Open Web talks. By being a tech speaker, I'll be able to deliver many talks about that.
There are so many people with great talent out there. By becoming a tech speaker, I hope to enable and inspire them to come forward and change the world.
The Web is not read-only, we need the users to create awesome contents for it.</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> This program would give me an opportunity to bring great talks to awesome people :)</p>

    <p><strong>Talks/slides:</strong> </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I’m qualified to be a Tech Speaker because I’m an active and enthusiastic member of the Mozilla community, currently building “Moz Aus” on my lonesome, I’ve got a passion for security and activism, and to round this all out I’m a decent public speaker looking to get better. I attended MozFest in 2016 as a volunteer, I’ve applied to run the Mozilla Campus Clubs program in Brisbane as the Mozilla Regional Coordinator and I’m just waiting on signoff of my year plan. I’ve spoken at CompCon 2016 and I’ve applied to speak at CrikeyCon 2017 and FOSDEM 2107.</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> My goal is to grow the open source community, particularly the Mozilla community in Brisbane and Australia at large. Australia has a great depth of technical skills, but too little is aimed at open source. I feel Australia is a bit of a sleeping giant with a large tech community that’s thinking to itself ‘I’d love to get involved but there isn’t anything open source happening’. It just needs a spark. If we can get another continent onboard and active with Mozilla it only bodes well for the Web.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I want to show the world how important and cool web technology is and how mozilla is contributing to the open standards in ways not everybody is seeing. Therefore I'll show how to use those technologies and how to contribute to be sure we have the open web we would like to have. I hope I have the chance to get involved more into mozilla projects and to motivate people to contribute while showing them what's possible and how to use mozilla initiated technologies.</p>

I have blogged about it here:
https://medium.com/@amitzur/i-m-a-frontend-happiness-engineer-b5e0180d9731#.3a66us33g

I engage with the community by giving talks and helping organize meetups. I am very active in the JS community in israel. To name a few groups:
https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-IL/
https://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-Israel/

I organize Tech Talks at my workplace where I indulge fellow colleagues to speak about something they are passionate about, and help them organize their presentation.
I also led my company's sponsorship to the biggest frontend conference in Israel (look for Capriza logo there, that's a culmination of my work):
http://yougottalovefrontend.com/#page-sponsors

I gave a talk at HTML5DevConf 2014 in San Francisco. They didn't upload my video, but the speaker page is still here:

</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I see public speaking as one of my main activities in my future career. Yet, I still haven't polished it to a level I'm content with.
I am passionate about technology and programming, as well as about education.
I think the community deserves more advocation for critical thinking. The current state of affairs is worrisome, both in the way standards are pushed, they way dev community treats it, the flame wars of frameworks, etc.
I would like to contribute a narrative that would help devs engage in shaping the open web rather than accepting it blindly or complaining about it.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I have been dedicated towards rust and community development for the past year in Mozilla Tamil Nadu community in India.

Mozilla communities have given me a lot of opportunity for tech evangelism and public speaking which has developed me to become a more confident person itself.

The one thing I like the most about public speaking is the experience that you could deliver that could change someone's pov and make a big difference.

Evangelizing the experience of being part of a Mozilla Community is an awesome feeling.

Through this program, I want to learn the cutting edge techniques for tech evangelism to become a complete rockstar for my community.

Recent events are my IOT meetup series where the members of the Mozilla club and Mozilla science study group in my region built a kickass real-time monitoring system.

Project Video Made in IOT Meetup series https://goo.gl/photos/jTVfwfimBshQLGVC7

Apart from that, I had pitched about my equal rating proposal in a campaign by the open innovation team in Bangalore.

You can find my other activities in the link below which are dedicated towards community development and Mozilla events, https://dvigneshwer.wordpress.com/category/mozilla/ </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> - Equip me with cutting edge tech speaking kits and techniques

- Network and learn from amazing developer evangelists 

- Improve my public speaking skills in terms of influencing people choices and deliver them better experiences in short time

I also talk about IOT and disability . for instance , I was a keynote speaker in many tech events such as Software freedom day Tunisia (2015 and 2016 editions) and droidcon tunisia 2016 . I also host web development workshops and I give talks about business & technology at my university.Being a motivational speaker to begin with has helped me  deliver an engaging performance when it comes to my tech talks using storytelling techniques , jokes, gamification and different tones .But there is always a room for improvement . Besides, I believe that being a tech speaker is more than just spreading technical stuff  . A hands on experience is a must . Indeed I have contributed to many open source projects like the urukproject. Overall , being a tech speaker has enabled me to empower others and guide them through .  It's time to take it to the next level thanks to Mozilla . I wanna fight alongside other mozillians for an open web .. a web accessible for all of us . that's why my upcoming tech talk will be about web accessibility . </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Thanks to the tech speakers program, I will be able to improve my public speaking skills so that I can give talks about web accessibility & attend tech events in other countries / regions (silicon valley is the dream!) . Besides, I want to support the disabled in the tech industry by breaking stereotypes . for example , there is no disabled tech speaker as far as I  can remember. Finally, I want to ensure that the future generations will carry on . I wanna make people believe in their dreams . I wanna change the world with Mozilla! </p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> becoming a mozilla tech speaker will allow me to write more relevant tech posts as a blogger.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I am a Computing Professor and a Chief Technology Officer in Darsis...

Technology has been one of the most powerful tool for human kind. At the end of the 1930’s Alan Turing gave birth to Computing, at the end of 1970’s Vint Cerf and Bob Khan gave us the Internet and by the end of 1980’s Tim Berners-Lee gave us the World Wide Web.

There is no doubt that Computing, Internet and the World Wide Web have changed dramatically the way we live and communicate with each other, as part of the Computing community both in Academia and Industry it is very important to me to increase the literacy of the people in these areas worldwide.

I have participated in several community technical projects, conferences and workshops with Mozilla México, the Mexican Association of Human-Computer Interaction, Wikimedia México and Startup Weekend – Education in Mexico City.

My technical skills include Web and Mobile Development, Interaction Design, Usability and UX Research and Project Management.

My technical areas of interest are Mobile Human-Computer Interaction, Interactive Distributed Systems, Mobile Computing Technologies, Multimodal User Interfaces, Theory of Computation, Compilers and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Being a Mozilla TechSpeaker will provide me the necessary tools and skills to contribute with the mission to keep Internet access and the World Wide Web healthy, open and accessible for all, not just in my home city (México) but in my country, my region and the world.

My professional experience and education as a Computing Engineer and a Master of Science in Mobile Computing Systems will help me with this endeavor.

I believe knowledge is freedom and evolution, Computing, Internet and the Web must be open and accessible for everyone and we all have to fight for it!!!</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> I love Mozilla's philosophy, Firefox, community, research and the Rust team I lead in México ;)</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I always give tech talks here in Brazil (in Portuguese) and during the last All Hands on Hawaii I have learned a lot about the Tech Speakers program. I want to improve my skills and learn new things as a speaker and I want to share my experiences with other people. 

I hope more people from Brazil get interested in the program, we have a lot of local events here and all of them always need technical people to speak and share new technologies!</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> During 2016 I made impressive progress getting a talk approved on The Developers Conference here in Brazil. For 2017 I want to improve my skills as a speaker, give talks in many Campus Party as possible (we have 3 different dates and places in Brazil now), give a new talk in The Developers Conference and try to attend BrazilJS. Also, I am the organizer of Tech Interior (we are on 3rd edition) an IT event for 120 participants. The program can help me improving my contacts network and I can improve the event in the next years!</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Hi y'alls!

I was until very recently the design on the Firefox Developer Tools team. I've given a total of five talks, all with an overarching theme: design, coding, and how they can work together to make great experiences. 

Before those first few awkward forays into public speaking, I helped found the DC Women Who Code chapter, where I ran workshops on getting started with web development, git, and javascript. Our main sponsor (Capital One) hired me and sent me to lots of university hackathons, where I'd field bizarre questions about web development as best I could.

If accepted to your program, I'd love to continue doing more talks on design and development and how they fit together. I'd like to do talks on experimental technologies like CSS Grid and how developers can use less traditional technologies like webgl in traditional settings.

I'm uncertain if that qualifies per se, but I'd love to be a part of the program!
—Helen</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I'd love to give more design and coding talks, but more specifically: I'd love to do a series of talks on the design fundamentals that developers, looking to build their own personal sites from scratch, would benefit from knowing by sharing my own workflows.

I'd like to increase my own technical know-how by learning new technologies such as webgl and the animation spec.

There are definitely specific conferences I'd love to attend, dotCSS and the CSSConf series being among them!</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> Mike Taylor recommended the program to me.I would love to stay a part of the Mozilla community here.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong>  I am a researcher in connecting things to the internet. Currently working on development of IoT-based technologies with IIT Indore, India  
Contributing to Open Source from last three years, I have volunteered many Events, Invited as a speaker at 100+ events related to open source. Currently, volunteering as evangelist and event organiser in Mozilla have managed and organised 150+ events promoting open source.
I was recently nominated as a speaker at Mozfest London, the annual festival of Mozilla that where we volunteered three full working days and gave a few lightning talk about Internet of things, web literacy, web privacy and how to begin contribution towards open source. I was selected as a volunteer in Digital Arts and Culture Space and also had a speaker session on LiFi.
Previously selected as a speaker in FOSS Asia 2016.


</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I believe in sharing the information because the more you share the more you learn. From last few years I have been involved in many events, workshops and talks.
Mozilla is a huge platform for anyone to spread his/her word to the world, and I want to share the information as much as I can for which I believe Mozilla is the perfect place. If I get a chance to be a tech speaker, I can learn and enhance my knowledge and skills.</p>

==Mozilla related== 
Firefox OS introduction - Open Source Conference Albania 2015 (oscal.openlabs.cc)
*Various talks in Open Labs Hackerspace (openlabs.cc)*

</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> What i hope to achieve by participating the Tech Speakers program is to better inform, and help more people join Connected Devices, as Internet of Things is advancing everyday with new solutions and applications (Everything is connected, from your toaster to your socks). This would help our local community since we are not too technical and software-hardware crossover is something usually unexplored. The more people contribute, the more secure Connected Devices (and IoT) becomes, which is a major concern about many people, and scares them from this technology.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I've been involved in organizing and presenting free libre open source technologies to audiences in Albania, Greece, Kosovo and cities around Europe for the last four years. These presentations have been related, but not limited to, Mozilla projects, Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, open data and LibreOffice to mention a few. 
In 2016 I presented during Mozilla Tech Speakers Tirana during both editions (April and December), hosted MozCaffe in February 2016 and facilitated the Mozilla meetup and infobooth presence during Open Source Conference Albania.  I have also presented and hosted all the events about Wiki Loves Monuments, the project that aims to improve geo-information at Wikipedia articles. In addition, I have hosted and mentored almost at all the localization sprints in Tirana related to FLOSS platforms such as Nextcloud and Fedora.

The majority of the activities I have hosted and presented are documented in my personal website: redon.skikuli.com.</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I have been mentoring the next generation of open source coders in the local hackerspace in Tirana since 2012. I strongly believe that now is the right time for me to share my passion for the open web, open data and online privacy with even more tech enthusiasts and Tech Speakers program seems to be the ideal (and as far as I know the only) platform to achieve this. 
If accepted, I would love to talk the importance of the challenges of the open web to the main FLOSS events such as FOSSDEM, CCC, DEF CON etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> I hope that T.S will hep me share my skills & passion for openness in technology to even more people</p>

Having spent the first part of my career as a playwright and theater director, I’m lucky to work in a job where I can explore technology’s capacity to transform the way we tell stories. This has led to my interest in VR and stories as user interfaces, and libraries like A-Frame and Twine. I have also directed and edited students working on tutorials for Git and Unity. I’ve spoken at Ancient City Ruby, Eurucamp and Nodevember.

</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong>  I want to enhance innovation in the virtual reality space by encouraging more diverse people to get involved with VR. A-Frame and WebVR are invaluable in this effort. I also want to meet new people who care about the web and building community.

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> My life in general is involved in anyway with technology, besides my
freelance jobs I am also active in helping NGO-s to use technology for 
their needs, an example could be sharing files or communications in a
private way. I have worked for investigative journalists, and that has
taught me a lot about security, and that was a really great way to
promote the Firefox and the secure browing options it offers.

My current focus is web development, I have experience in writing
back-end application, but now the front-end world has caught my eye,
specially with new webgl and webvr stuff coming to the scene it gets me
always excited to learn and speak about it.I'd like also to point to my
reps profile https://reps.mozilla.org/u/ardian/. I also taught Ruby on
Rails to 15 students this year which has made my presenter skills even
more better. I am also writing for SitePoint you can find some articles
in this link that I wrote https://www.sitepoint.com/author/ahaxha/ (I
posted this link above too) 

I spoke to all the OSCAL (Open Source
Conference Albania) conferences and spoke there
http://oscal.openlabs.cc/events/ardian-haxha/
http://oscal.openlabs.cc/2015/speakers/
http://oscal.openlabs.cc/2014/speakers/

I co-organized 8 SFK(Software Freedom Kosoova)conferences with ~300 visitors

Spoke at POINT conference

    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I really love that this application is just before the new year, my goal for this year is to train more people in public speaking and help overcome the fear of public presentations. I'd like to visit more conferences this year and start a vlog on YouTube and make regular videos for the conferences I attend. I'd like make more VR and webgl talks in 2017. To end this question, I'd like to attend that I am really honored to have the opportunity to apply to this program, and I hope I can give more to this community.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> First time hearing about Mozilla Tech Speakers program was at Mozilla Leadership Summit from Havi Hoffman in Singapore, I was stoked and inspired though I was hesitant to join the first batch of the program. I'm very much inspired by Mozilla and it's diverse community and the contribution paths available. Having been part of the community for the past 5+ years as a REP, this has been a fun journey and still feel comfortable in the community. Having this in mind, I constantly try on new things in the community, I have been mostly involved in community building and leadership but always looked for projects within Mozilla that would allow me to speak about things I care most as a tech evangelist and open source enthusiast.

Bearing in mind that the program is tailored for technical evangelists, I feel I have the right skills and enthusiasm that this program requires, however I’m happy that I'm pursuing this path. Having vast experience attending tech conferences (regionally, globally and locally) and giving keynotes, I strongly believe this is the right program to develop my public speaking skills further, learning from others and at the same time advocating for Mozilla's mission.</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I am fervent about advocating for open web especially as a learning tool, investing in the skills of Mozillian’s in my community, building the accomplishments and leadership of volunteers.  My goal is to improve the lives of both men and women in sub-saharan Africa by leveraging the power of the open Internet. I want to tap into existing Mozilla communities of educators, learners, and open Internet advocates in the region. While also connecting the work and leaders to the larger Mozilla community, and engaging those in other African countries to start engaging in Tech Speaker program to continue growing movement.</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> Long term Mozillian inspired to do this for sub-saharan region. </p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Being outgoing, participating for quite some time now at different FLOSS projects, having presented at audiences with different level of technical knowledge and promoting the Mozilla manifesto are some of the elements that will hopefully give more value to the Tech Speakers program.

I have been a Mozillian and Firefox Student Ambassador for almost three years. Contributing and editor in Open Street Map in the last year. 
Having said this I have held a lot of different talks around university campuses in Tirana (Agricultural University) and also held talk at Nature Sciences University in Tirana and Informatics. 
The talks I have been mostly presenting were Mozilla related like: "How to contribute to Mozilla" and "Importance of having an Open Web". In the beginning of December we had Wikiweekend Tirana where I did an introduction to open street map and presented the project of Wikimedia: WikiLovesMaps http://wikiweekend.openlabs.cc/</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I would like to present the topics that I have been familiar with, during the last years. " How to start contributing to Mozilla" and also "Open Source Technologies for Agriculture" 

The Mozilla Tech Speakers Program will serve as an important opportunity to help promote Mozilla technologies and initiatives not only within my area, but also regionally.
At the same time, it will significantly aid at increasing my personal public speaking skills. Additionally, it will gradually help me become more effective in communicating with others and making me more confident with people.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Speaking with others or in front of others as a speaker is my hobby. I guess I took my hobby seriously. 

I started as a QA contributor in Mozilla through Mozilla QA Bangladesh and Mozilla Bangladesh. When there was any events regarding QA, I was there to speak. 

And now I'm also in Mozilla Tech Speakers Bangladesh and it's really awesome to speak in front of people.

I like to speak, I like to talk about technology and let people know about tech through my voice. 

As a tech speaker I already took some sessions in several events arranged by Mozilla Tech Speakers Bangladesh.
</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Web and Internet is a big thing today. But still there's 3 billion people left behind who is not in any touch of them. I wanna speak for those who knows about it and who doesn't even know, So that those who knows may let other know and those who don't, may know. Web is for everyone. That's why everyone should have the opportunity to know and use it. And those who use it in wrong way, should be stopped. That's why we need to raise our voice. That's why I'm raising my voice!</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> Hope this speaking sessions may continue and we get to know and speak about many things.

    <p><strong>Talks/slides:</strong> </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I focus in how you can contribute at Mozilla, how you can start you path and how easy is even in you are starting your developer path. 

I organize and participate in a thon of Hackahtons along the year and I help the participants in web development and how can easily can debug their webapp in Firefox Dev Tools.

This year I focus with other 2 Mexican Mozillians in recruit more technical people that can use nightly, the effort is slowly but steady giving results. 
</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong>  To improve my technical speaking skills and hive better and more accurate presentations. 

I want to talk about how to patch your first firefox bug all the way that is necessary to patch a bug in the core, also for the people who already is using nightly how they can submit valuable bugs.

For the Mexican community one the biggest weakness is the lack of technical Mozillians involved, with the help of the tech speakers program I believe that we can turn this around. 




</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> Mexico have an amazing developer ecosystem, with a ton of meetups along the country.

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I am a mozillian for more than 4 years now and I had the chance to speak in more than 20 local events about technical and non-technical topics. As a developer, I always like to share the awesome tools and technologies like Firefox OS, WebVR, Firefox Devtools and Git. I also organized a lot of workshops about FirefoxOS at universities and technology events in Tunisia or geeks meetups, from how to start to reach advanced techniques in web developments. Besides FirefoxOS, I was invited many times to organize workshops about HTML 5, Javascript, NodeJS and Git. I am also a (web) designer so I enjoy a lot talking about how close some technologies are to art and design in some of the local designers meetups in Tunisia. There is a full list of talks and workshops I held as a community member in my reps reports : https://reps.mozilla.org/u/MedMack/ </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong>  I am a self-taught developer, with all the talksI gave, and I didn't find difficulties talking technical details with people with developer, as most of our event where in universities. Now I am no longer a student and I believe it will get harder talking in a higher level events. My goals for joining the Tech Speakers program is to develop my speaking and presenting skills so I can be present in a higher level events, I still feel  I'm lacking skills and materials to reach that and I hope this can be done with the help of the program.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I mostly attend events to talk about the Mozilla Learning Networks and the work we do the teach digital literacy skills. A lot of these revolves around the Web Literacy Map and the skills needed in the 21st century. I'm also really interested in VR, although I haven't given any talks about it.

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I have been involved in speaking about technical topics as well as motivational talks. Most recently, I have been piloting the Africa Code Week activities in Cape Town in 2016, which has drawn a lot of media attention as the single most successful individual Africa Code Week program run from any of the initiatives across the continent. The initiative teaches basic coding skills to learners that have had no access to this type of training before. I gave one of the speeches at the closing ceremony of Africa Code Week.  

I have a relationship with Mozilla through my involvement as a Techwomen 2015 fellow, and have included the Mozilla Foundation Girls based in the Cape Town townships as participants of the Africa Code Week. We dedicated one full day to training Mozilla girls in Khayelitsha. 

I believe being a Mozilla Tech speaker will only amplify the impact that I am able to have across this country and the continent. The local media have already shown interest in next year's activities, and I already have a conference slot lined up for April to speak to teachers about coding and digital literacy.  </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I would like to join the program in order to amplify the impact that I have when speaking about bringing coding skills and digital literacy to marginalised communities. I also want to make the most of the media opportunities already lined up for 2017 about coding.

I enjoy speaking, and I want to get better at it and increase my network of likeminded people. 

There's many amazing tools that Mozilla has made available freely on the web, and I believe it is our duty to help make sure as many people learn about it and can benefit from it. </p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> My experience as a Rep bring me to some places to talk about web development. I usually focus to talk about web development for beginner (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and teach some php frameworks. 

And just this year, I start to show more interest to share & introduce new Mozilla technologies like MozVR & Rust. I'm not an avid speaker, actually. But I think I have enough experience that I can probably expand to the next level through this program. </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I love sharing. And as a Rep, I speak in various places in my region to share about Mozilla technology. My goal from joining this program is that so I can be a better public speaker locally that can share about Mozilla technology in a better way. It's so hard to find technical people that aware of Mozilla technology in my local region, that's why I feel this is a call for me to step in & prepare myself with the skills that I'll need to accomplish my goal. </p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> I'm very passionate to join this program so that I can show that the girls can also do it. (:</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> ¡Hola!

My focus has been for a while on spreading the word on the benefits of using Firefox Nightly as your daily browser.

I've done some talks and workshops that you can see at my Reps profile[1]

The major highlights for me are a workshop I did on the subject of Nightly that was completelly full during Campus Party Mexico [2] and being party of the demo team at the Mozilla both during Mobile World Congress 2015.

2 | http://campuse.ro/events/default-event/workshop/se-un-firefox-beta-aurora-o-nightly-tester-en-5-minutos-cpmx5/</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I'd like to keep preaching on the adoption of Nightly to technical audiences locally and all around the world.

Specifically, I would like to be better at submitting talk proposals and learning of talking opportunities well ahead of time and not learn of them when the due dates are too close or already past.

My dream is once talk about Nightly at https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> I speak Spanish natively and both English and Italian fluently.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I’ve been a Mozillian from almost 2 years and a Mozilla Rep for a few months.

I’ve actively spoken at various events conducted by the local community in and around Delhi, India. I am a big fan of Mozilla and enjoy spreading the word around people on privacy issue and how they can contribute to Open Source. 

I’ve spoken at various events on technical topics like "Learning version control with GIT" to "Contributing to Mozilla central" code base. I’ve recently spoken about "Marionette and Firefox UI tests".

Have participated in Dev sprints organized by Mozilla Mozpacers and spoken on technical topics attended by even 100+ audience.

Blog link: http://www.sanyamkhurana.com/blog/tag/mozilla

Mozilla Reps Activities: https://reps.mozilla.org/u/CuriousLearner/</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I’d like to develop my presentation and speaking skills. Getting feedback from fellow Mozillians is very essential to develop skills as a technical speaker. 

This would also help me to better evangelize about Mozilla – and would enable me to bring up more technical contributors from the local community. 

I don’t see many people who are contributing technically (patching bugs for Mozilla) in the local community; and I definitely want to change that.

Mozilla Tech speaker would be a great opportunity for me to further recruit tech Mozillians from India and improve the overall culture of the Open Source movement.

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> My story began with Mozilla since i was 12 years old, I was impressed by the Mozilla project and then i decided to make a platform here in my county for all the people which have a passion about Mozilla and it's missions, I was one of the co-founders of Mozilla Community in Egypt and i was responsible for building a strong community that can help others to contribute effectively to Mozilla so we started to make some events and activities to explain what is Mozilla and what is the Mozilla project and how can people contribute with us, Now i'm a Mozilla Rep and i'm a team leader at Mozilla Egypt and now i'm responsible for graphic and web design training which is a training for all the people have passion about learning new graphic design and web skills and also to build some VR projects now most of the trainees applied in different programs in Mozilla which means now they do contributions in the community. 
Now after the Arabic Gathering i'm responsible for the WebVR project so i made the OpenMoz Day to help people to know more about WebVR and  how to make projects using A FRAME</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Excellent communication and presentation skills are some of the most important skills that any team leader should have to be able to express his ideas.

It's not easy being a team leader,It needs hard work and focusing on your technical and soft skills to be a good team leader. It is even harder to deal with the challenges that you will face during your mission as a team leader.

This program will give me a great push to start developing  presentation skills to be able to deal with any kind of new challenges in the future. </p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I am a full-stack web developer and have experience running a web development team. You can find more about it on http://eadnan.com

I like to introduce new tools and workflows. In presentations, I try to share from my experience and mistakes to hint people on how to get on the right track.

On a personal level, I do research to do things in a better way and try to find out if there are ways to do something in a better way than we are used to do.

I am becoming graduate this January after my undergraduate life full of activities. It would be a great privilege to keep working with the community as a speaker.

I am always up for learning something new and taking on challenges.</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> To improve my public speaking skills and get more opportunities to share. I think tech speakers would be the most efficient way for me to contribute for open web at a large scale. After all, public speaking is my second passion right after exploration.</p>

In one year, Mozilla changed my life completely. I am meeting new people across globe, interacting with them and learning a lot of things. I want to spread this message of 'open web' to other people also. I want to organise workshop mostly about open source and why one should get involved, Rust-the programming language and also on Web VR. I will be graduating with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering in 2017 and I think this program will be helpful for me. I am passionate about Python and therefore I am organiser of Django Girls Workshop in Nagpur. Other than technical, I mainly work for women empowerment.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Related to technical focus mostly I've done workshops rather than talks. I already know C++, Java, HTML, JS and a bit of Python, that's why my focus for the moment is python and php. I'm looking for opportunities like Tech Speakers to attend different events/conferences and share my technical knowledge/skills with others, mostly girls, because as I mentioned during my talk lots of girls are being part of open source communities but just a small percentage of them are developers/coders. Let's motivate them!

    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> As I mentioned during my talk I've attended different conferences talking about Women in Open Source because the gender gap is one of the most discussed topics since ever. The number of women being part of open source communities is increasing day by day, but the number of women that are developers/coders is still really low. Raising this number is one of my goals that I want to accomplish and achieve in this program. </p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> I want to be part of this amazing team in order to exchange our experiences!</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Previously, in local Mozilla events, I was focused on Firefox OS app development and Gaia development. I was an organizer and speaker of Firefox OS App training Event in Sylhet, Bangladesh. Technically, I do web developing and made code contribution on Firefox Marketplace earlier and achieved recognition- https://blog.mozilla.org/apps/2015/07/02/friend-of-marketplace-atique-ahmed-ziad/ Currently contributing to Addons Mozilla and a few months ago, I was chosen as Friend of Add-ons- https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/10/05/friend-of-add-ons-atique-ahmed-ziad . Currently, I am studying about Rust and webExtension. Well, I have organized web compatibility sprint and Firefox Test Pilot event recently in my local area. I have organized 5 events since last year and participated in around 10 local Mozilla events. In upcoming days I am going to hold some Rust events, WebVR events, webExtensions hackathon and bug fixing hackathon on Addons Mozilla project. I am a learner who is passionate about Mozilla's web technologies and I am spreading what I am learning through organizing and speaking in events and hackathons. Maybe that's why I can qualify to be a Mozilla Tech Speaker. </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> To me speaking in an event has always been a pressure. Speaking on any technical topic makes my knowledge solid. I am passionate about web technologies and Mozilla's open source codebases. I want to give talks regarding these topics in various events all around the world. Also, speaking in front of massive people is a great honor to me. I have already submitted my talks about webExtention and WebVR for FOSSASIA 2017 which will be held on March, 2017. So, I want to join Mozilla Tech Speakers program to develop my public speaking skill for the upcoming events.</p>

I've started to make talks in 2012, before I get involved with Mozilla, and when I started to contribute I have intensified the number of talks, talking about Mozilla. I've talked in events like Campus Party Brazil and FISL.

My linked talks are in Portuguese, so I'm sorry for this.

I think that if we can be more tech speakers in Brazil, we will could help our community to grow, help our volunteers and engage them more.

2. Privacy Month 2017: https://reps.mozilla.org/e/privacy-month-campaign-2017/
My main focus area during any event or a session is Privacy, Security and Web Literacy. In such events, I generally talk about tools and technologies which help make online experience more secure such as add-ons such as Lightbeam, Privacy Badger etc, and some web apps such as Pinopticlick by EFF.

    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Tech Speakers program gives a global platform for speakers to take their experience of public speaking and knowledge to a broader audience. Through this program, I would get a more wide range of topics to talk about and to a wide range of people. This comes at a very appropriate time as we are about to kick off our Privacy Month Campaign which brings along a whole series of offline events and workshops. Being a part of this program would teach me what a good speaker should and should not do, facing any size of audience.</p>

I have taught from the students of small villages to the university professor. I have done the 'Kidzilla BIT' Event for educating the people of the rural areas. here is the link : https://mi10tech.wordpress.com/kidzillabit-varnama/ Youtube link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_daL-5ip9zM. I have also spoke about the web technologies, Internet of Things, Arduino and the basics of WebVR and Rust to the university students. Due to the broad experience in technology i got invited to attend Microsoft's Build tour and got a chance to meet Mr.Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO) when he was on asia's tour. Also hosted Hackathon powered by GitHub. I have been selected for Hackathon of 36 hours by arduino and made a product in 36 hours and pitched it and so much praised by the judges. In the January month i am going to hold Open Source Hackathon and will also opening the club there and talk about the contribution areas in the Mozilla. I am super TechoGeek and love to keep up to date myself with latest technologies. In February i'm going to organize WebVR Camp. And Very soon i am going to learn advance level of web technologies. </p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> My main aim behind applying for tech speaker is to share my knowledge to the maximum people i can.I get the inner happiness when i teach about the web and technologies into rural areas as well as tech people. I see many creative people in but so many of them don't know where to utilize it, so when i talk with them about technologies and those guys their mix up their creativity and learned technologies and make the best out of it. So being a Mozilla Tech Speaker it helps me achieve inner happiness in the techy way. ;)</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> Its the best time to share my knowledge on the professional level. Video: http://tinyurl.com/mts2017</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong>  In my second year at the college I gave two training courses (A+ and Networking security) and I have certificates for them both, then I used to give workshops in different fields of IT (such as IoT, Programming, security and ethical hacking, localization on the web, web literacy and many others).
I participate in many events talking about IT, Mozilla services and its role in the web openness, and web literacy as a part of Mozilla campus activities because I am a club captain.
I also make events and workshops for technical and non technical people teaching them many important aspects that allow them to live the technology and be a part of it.</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Because I believe in teaching and learning and the rights of people to learn every new aspect in technology because it is not for people who can do the search and learn by themselves, we have to teach people especially who face some obstacles looking for the information they need.
The ability to participate in events talking about Mozilla in general and the technical aspects in specific and how to learn and benefit from it </p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I am student of Bachelor in Electronics and Computer Engineering at IOE Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal which is the oldest and most prestigious University of Nepal and offers quality and low cost higher education as it is sponsored by Nepal Government thus has been attraction on the eyes of Nepalese science students and have to compete in highly competitive entrance examination to grab a seat. I have been serving as a community correspondent for IOE FOSS (campus) community and also have been keeping on Mozilla Nepal activities. 
I have been involved in educating the young engineers in our college the importance of open-source software, open-web, privacy and need to move from pirated software so that national software industry can be developed. We have been unsuccessfully trying to move the group towards contributing to the open source community. 
I seek from this program to break the ice of participating in open source community which is used by global community. This exposure would help introverted person like me to make some new friends and also more easily convince friends in my college about the importance of the open source and help them to take their first step in open source community.        
</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> The goal I have set from this program is to enhance my capability to convince more people to join the open source community in my college which I think can bring some talented people of Nepal to the open source community as it is the one of the most competitive college. I hope I could start mozilla campus community in our college and get more involved in mozilla community.</p>

    <p class="longform"><strong>Qualifications:</strong> I have good communication and presentation skills. I can easily convey my thoughts through my words to the audience and that's a speaker should be like who can represent himself in the audience. As I talk for technical domains, specifically Mozilla related talks, I am pretty sure that I am qualified to be a Mozilla Tech Speaker.I have organized a dozen of technical events in my whole journey as an Mozillian till now. I have taken workshops on various technologies such as Java , HTML , Drupal etc. Recently, I organized a event on Virtual Reality and talked about Mozilla VR and WebVR. When I was in college, I gave a workshop on a designing software to all the faculties of my Computer Science department. In general, I talk about Open Source and Mozilla. I am a Open Source evangelist and Mozilla lover and always love to talk about Mozilla whenever I get an opportunity.</p>
    <p class="longform"><strong>Motivation:</strong> If I would get an opportunity to become a Mozilla Tech Speaker, I will be able to learn speaking skills from expert speakers that I may lack currently and thus will build and enhance my tech speaking skills. I am also going to deliver a talk on Open Web in my city very soon. As a Mozilla Tech Speaker, I would like to represent my community in the events or meetup organized by Mozilla for volunteers and Mozillians. At the end of day, I want to earn expertise in public speaking and this program is best for it.</p>
    <p><strong>Anything else:</strong> I am a passionate Mozillian. I have delivered talks on Mozilla more than 12 times.</p>

I also mentor a Technovation team (aimed at teaching girls coding and entrepreneurial skills.  We discover that so many teens and students want to learn but there are few hands, so we are also doing an event in January for computer science teachers in schools in my community, this is to expose them to Mozilla clubs in for middle school and high school students. It is happening in January because the school term is over this year. After which then register students in interested schools.
